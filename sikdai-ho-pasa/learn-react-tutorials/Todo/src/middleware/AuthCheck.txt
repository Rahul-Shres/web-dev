In this code, the comments explain the purpose and functionality of each part:

The useHistory hook is imported from the 'react-router-dom' module. This hook allows accessing the history object, which provides navigation functionality.
The AuthCheck component is created as a functional component.
The useHistory hook is used to access the history object, which will be used for navigation.
The code checks if the 'loggedIn' key is not present in the localStorage.
If the key is not present, it means the user is not logged in.
In that case, the code redirects the user to the login page using history.replace("/login").
The replace() function replaces the current page with the specified path ("/login" in this case).
