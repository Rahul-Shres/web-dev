Explanation:

The code sets up an Express server by importing and creating an instance of the express module.
It also loads environment variables from a .env file using dotenv package and logs the value of the mongo_connect variable.
 - npm install dotenv
The server listens for a GET request on the root URL ("/") and sends a JSON response with a "Hello World" message.
Finally, the server is started on port 8000, and a message is logged to indicate that the server is running.

Connecting NodeJs Server to MongoDB
npm install mongoose
// Importing the mongoose module for MongoDB database interaction
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Fetching the value of the environment variable mongo_connect
const mongo_connect = process.env.mongo_connect;

// Connecting to MongoDB using the mongo_connect URL
mongoose
  .connect(mongo_connect, {})
  .then(() => {
    // Logging a success message when the connection is established
    console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    // Logging an error message if the connection fails
    console.log("Failed to connect to MongoDB");
  });


The code imports the mongoose module for interacting with MongoDB databases.
It fetches the value of the environment variable mongo_connect, which should contain the MongoDB connection URL.
The mongoose.connect() method is called to establish a connection to MongoDB using the mongo_connect URL.
If the connection is successful, a success message is logged.
If the connection fails, an error message is logged.
