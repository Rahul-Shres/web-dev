The MainPage component represents the main page of the application.
The code retrieves the 'todo' item from localStorage and parses it as JSON using conditional (ternary) operator.
The history object is accessed from the useHistory hook to enable navigation.
The handleAddTodo function handles the event when the user clicks on the "Add todo" button. It uses history.push() to navigate to the '/add' page.
The component renders a Navbar component and a container for displaying todos.
If there are todos (getTodo has a length greater than 0), the todos are mapped and rendered as individual div elements with a link to view details.
If there are no todos, a message is displayed along with a button to add a new todo.
