Table Creation:

The code dynamically creates tables for organizations (organization_${organizationNumber}) 
and forums (forum_${organizationNumber}) based on the organizationNumber. This suggests a structure
 where each tenant (organization) has its own segregated database tables.

 
User Association:

The users_org table maintains an association between users and their respective organizations.
 It references the users table and uses userId and organizationNumber to establish this link.
Isolation of Data:

Data for each organization seems to be isolated in their dedicated tables (organization_${organizationNumber}). 
This separation ensures that each tenant's data remains distinct from others.
